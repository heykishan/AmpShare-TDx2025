# AmpShare-TDx2025

AmpShare is an innovative platform that connects EV drivers with available private charging stations, creating a robust peer-to-peer network that maximizes existing infrastructure and accelerates electric vehicle adoption.

## Overview

The platform operates through two distinct user journeys:
- **AmpSharers** - Charger owners who register their equipment and set availability windows
- **PowerSeekers** - EV drivers who locate and reserve nearby available charging stations

By transforming idle private chargers at apartments, communities, and businesses into accessible resources, AmpShare addresses a critical barrier to EV adoption while creating potential revenue opportunities for charger owners.

## Features
